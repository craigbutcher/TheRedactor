        <h1>Perfect cup of tea needs a pinch of salt and squeeze of lemon, says US chemist</h1>
        <h2>Scientist suggests using a short, stout mug and steeping quickly but with plenty of squeezing to create ideal brew.</h2>
        <p>A scientist from the country where you can find tea being made with lukewarm water from the tap claims to have found the recipe for a perfect cuppa.</p>
        <p>The secret, according to Michelle Francl, a professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr College, is a pinch of salt – and energetic squeezing of the teabag.</p>
        <p>“You get some awful cups of tea in the US. People here often use lukewarm water straight from a tap. It’s horrific,” Francl said. “I grew up in the midwest, which is deep coffee-drinking country, but tea has always been my preferred drink – and I have invested a lot of time into studying it.</p>
        <p>"But even after all these years of drinking tea and researching chemistry, I learned new things about what is in my cup and how to make the very best cup of tea.”</p>
        <p>In less controversial advice, Francl suggests using short, stout mugs as they have less surface area, so keep tea hotter. Pre-heating your mug or teapot is crucial, she says: the warmth increases the amount of caffeine and antioxidants released which, she says, creates vital “aromatic compounds”.</p>
        <p>Finally, settling the question that has troubled British tea drinkers and snobs for centuries – whether to be a miffy (milk in first) or not – Francl found that milk should be added after pouring the tea to reduce the chance of it curdling. The milk, she added, should be warmed.</p>
        <p>Also key to a perfect cuppa is the use of larger teabags that allow the tea leaves to move around, keeping them in contact with the water – although ideally, you should use loose leaves.</p>
        <p>Further advice – that should surely be unnecessary for even the most casual of tea aficionados – is that both teabags and loose leaves should be used only once.</p>
        <p>“The research shows that the size of the bag really matters, not the shape, but some shapes give you more space,” said Francl. “Tea leaves expand by maybe a factor of four or five and if you don’t give them enough space, there’s not enough good access from the solvent.</p>
        <p>Francl analysed research papers and ancient texts dating back more than 1,000 years to devise the best brew, documenting these experiments in her new book, Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea.</p>
